# MtgRocket
Magic The Gathering integration for <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket.Chat</a>.

## Overview 
With this integration, you can retrieve a card image from the game Magic The Gathering, with a simple command.

## How to use
When installed, you can simply write `!card` followed by a card name, for example: `!card ulamog`. The plug-in will search for cards with that name, and display the first card from the search results.
<br />

<br />
You can also search for exact card names, by putting the card name in quotation marks, for example: `!card "Opt"` will return the card "Opt".

## Installation

#### Configure outgoing Webhook in Rocket.Chat
In your Rocket.Chat instance go to administration panel and click on "Integrations". Click on "NEW INTEGRATION".<br />
Next, choose "Outgoing WebHook".

Now, on the webhook config screen, set the following values:
<br /><br />

##### Enabled
Set this value to true/yes
<br /><br />

##### Name (optional)
Enter the desired name for the integration (e.g. "MtgRocket").
<br /><br />

##### Channel
This is self-explaining. Insert the desired channel which should be listened.
<br /><br />

##### Trigger Word
Set the trigger word on which the command should be fired. Write `!card` here. You can technically write anything here, but then the script won't work.
<br /><br />

In this field you *must* enter `https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/`. Very important!
<br /><br />

## Extras
There are other options you can modify to enhance this plug-in, like the sender if you have other bots active. This guide is just for a basic vanilla type setup. <br />
If you feel brave you can modify the source code to better suit your needs.

## Remarks
This plug-in makes use of the excellent unofficial <a href="https://magicthegathering.io/">magicthegathering.io</a> API.

## Development
There are room for several improvements, which I might get around doing eventually, like handling errors of the API is unreachable and so on. If you have suggestions or additions to the source code, feel free to contact me.
